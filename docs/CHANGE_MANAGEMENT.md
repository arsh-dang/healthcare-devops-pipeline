# Change Management Procedures

## Purpose
This document outlines the change management procedures for the Healthcare Application to ensure that all changes to production systems are implemented in a controlled and secure manner, minimizing risks to system availability, security, and compliance.

## Scope
These procedures apply to all changes affecting:
- Application code and configuration
- Infrastructure and cloud resources
- Database schema and data
- Security controls and policies
- Third-party integrations

## Change Management Process

### 1. Change Request Submission
All changes must be initiated through a formal change request that includes:
- **Change Description**: Detailed description of the proposed change
- **Business Justification**: Reason for the change and expected benefits
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact on systems, users, and compliance
- **Risk Assessment**: Security, operational, and compliance risks
- **Rollback Plan**: Steps to revert the change if needed
- **Testing Plan**: How the change will be tested before production deployment
- **Timeline**: Proposed implementation schedule

### 2. Change Classification
Changes are classified into three categories:

#### Standard Changes
- Pre-approved changes following established procedures
- Low risk with predictable outcomes
- Examples: Security patches, minor configuration updates
- Can be implemented without full Change Advisory Board (CAB) review

#### Normal Changes
- Require CAB review and approval
- Moderate to high risk or impact
- Examples: New features, infrastructure changes, database modifications

#### Emergency Changes
- Required to restore service or address critical security issues
- Can be implemented immediately with post-implementation CAB review
- Must still follow security and testing requirements where possible

### 3. Change Advisory Board (CAB)
The CAB is responsible for reviewing and approving changes:
- **Composition**: IT Manager, Security Officer, Compliance Officer, Development Lead, Operations Lead
- **Meeting Frequency**: Weekly for normal changes, as needed for emergencies
- **Decision Criteria**:
  - Business justification is clear and compelling
  - Risk assessment is adequate
  - Testing and rollback plans are appropriate
  - Compliance requirements are met
  - Resource availability is confirmed

### 4. Testing and Validation

#### Development Testing
- Unit tests for code changes
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Security testing for vulnerability assessment
- Performance testing for capacity validation

#### Staging Environment Testing
- End-to-end testing in staging environment
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Security scanning and penetration testing
- Compliance validation

#### Production Validation
- Smoke tests post-deployment
- Monitoring for performance and errors
- User feedback collection
- Incident response readiness

### 5. Implementation Procedures

#### Pre-Implementation
- Backup all affected systems and data
- Notify stakeholders of planned downtime
- Prepare monitoring and alerting systems
- Confirm rollback procedures are tested

#### Implementation
- Follow approved implementation plan
- Monitor system performance in real-time
- Document any deviations from plan
- Maintain communication with stakeholders

#### Post-Implementation
- Verify successful deployment
- Monitor for issues during stabilization period
- Update documentation and configuration management
- Conduct post-implementation review

### 6. Rollback Procedures
Every change must have a documented rollback plan:
- **Timeframe**: Rollback must be possible within 4 hours of deployment
- **Testing**: Rollback procedures must be tested in staging before production
- **Documentation**: Step-by-step rollback instructions
- **Communication**: Notification procedures during rollback

### 7. Documentation and Reporting

#### Change Records
All changes must be documented including:
- Change request details
- Approval records
- Implementation results
- Post-implementation review
- Lessons learned

#### Reporting
- Monthly change management reports to management
- Incident reports for failed changes
- Compliance reports for regulatory requirements
- Trend analysis for process improvement

### 8. Compliance and Security Considerations

#### HIPAA Compliance
- Changes affecting patient data must maintain HIPAA security
- Risk assessments must consider privacy impact
- Audit logging must capture change activities

#### SOC 2 Compliance
- Changes must not compromise security controls
- Access controls must be maintained during changes
- Change activities must be logged for audit purposes

#### Security Requirements
- Security scans must pass before production deployment
- Access controls must be verified post-change
- Vulnerability assessments must be current

### 9. Emergency Change Procedures
For emergency changes:
1. **Assessment**: Determine if change qualifies as emergency
2. **Documentation**: Create emergency change request
3. **Implementation**: Proceed with implementation following security protocols
4. **Notification**: Notify CAB within 24 hours
5. **Review**: CAB review within 5 business days
6. **Documentation**: Complete change record post-implementation

### 10. Continuous Improvement
- Regular review of change management effectiveness
- Analysis of change success rates and failure causes
- Process improvements based on lessons learned
- Training updates for staff

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Change Initiator
- Submits change requests
- Provides detailed change information
- Participates in testing and implementation

### Change Manager

- Approves changes for production

## Training Requirements
All staff involved in change management must receive training on:
- Change management procedures
- Risk assessment methodologies
- Testing and validation procedures
- Compliance requirements
- Emergency change procedures

## Audit and Compliance
